# Adaptive Grade Calculator

This is my outline for a grade calculator for students to find their current and projected grades given a syllabus and various data pertaining to their class assignments.


#### **GOALS**

1) take syllabus and associate it with a class
	- extract data (ocr or text recog. api)
	- assign dates with assignments and weighting per type/assignment (ai)
2) allow student to edit data before saving it
	- saves to account to be accessible anytime app in opened with the account
3) will upload data to an in-app calendar and allow for upload to external services
4) send notification to remind student of deadlines
5) place for student to enter grade of specific assignments and tests 
6) calculated the current grade based on covered assignments with data that has been input
7) projects the estimated final grade based on the current average score per assignment 
8) way for students to edit/add assignment data and grades and add more if needed
